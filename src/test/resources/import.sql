-- Test data for account-manager tests
-- This file is loaded by Hibernate in test mode with drop-and-create strategy

-- Note: The accounts table will be created by Hibernate in test mode
-- since we use drop-and-create strategy for tests

-- No initial test data needed for accounts - tests create their own
